    "#Natural Language is how we, humans, exchange ideas and opinions. There are two main mediums for natural language – speech and text. \n",
    "#Listening and reading are effortless for a healthy human, but they’re difficult for a machine learning algorithm. That’s why scientists had to come up with Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
    "#What is Natural Language Processing?\n",
    "#NLP enables computers to process human language and understand meaning and context, along with the associated sentiment and intent behind it, and eventually, use these insights to create something new.\n",
    "#NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Vectorization is jargon for a classic approach of converting input data from its raw format (i.e. text ) into vectors of real numbers which is the format that ML models support. This approach has been there ever since computers were first built, it has worked wonderfully across various domains, and it’s now used in NLP.\n",
    "# In Machine Learning, vectorization is a step in feature extraction. The idea is to get some distinct features out of the text for the model to train on, by converting text to numerical vectors.\n",
